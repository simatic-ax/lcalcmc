| Member | Type | Default Value | Description |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `a0` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t0 (start acceleration = 0.0) |
| `a1` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t1 (end of phase where the acceleration is increased = first jerk phase) |
| `a2` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t2 (end of phase where the acceleration is constant) |
| `a3` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t3 (end of phase where the acceleration is decreased = second jerk phase) |
| `a4` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t4 (end of phase where the acceleration is zero = constant velocity phase) |
| `a5` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t5 (end of phase where the deceleration is increased = third jerk phase) |
| `a6` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t6 (end of phase where the deceleration is constant) |
| `a7` | `LREAL` | 0.0 | Acceleration at t7 (end of phase where the deceleration is decreased = fourth jerk phase). End acceleration = 0.0 |
